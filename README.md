My name is Finn Xuvgo, a former XFAC Arkan. I designed superweapons used to take down RBs, specifically titans. I liked my life back at ARKA, I had great friends, tight but tight enough schedules, and projects I created and treasure. However, because of my exemplary portfolio, I was moved to another XFAC branch called QUFA. The only differences in my new employed position is that I'm working three pyex away from where I used to work, so it would take me 2 years to visit my old pals, and 2 years going back, so visiting isn't a choice I can make. The higher ups mentioned that ARKA will be focused on hunting reality breakers and that QUFA will be focusing on universe assimilation with RB permanent damages. I'd build gigantic photon blasters less and build some space warping technology more, which I'm not very fond of. I've met a handful of brilliant minds here in pyex 562, but they're not as lively as my old peers in pyex 559. I presume engineers and scientists aren't as fun compared to hunters.
